# Sentiment_WebApp
This is a repo for one of my KaggleX 2023 Mentorship projects. 
This app will take user input and give back a sentiment score. 

It will take in user input from a web app, and produce a sentiment grading of that text.

Reflection Notes:
Nice to have additions:
- sentiment as a score 0-1
- summary sentiment score for whole text
- color coding in word cloud to reflect sentiment
- allow bulk insert and scoring
- api connector to model?

Use cases for this app
- email overview (check tone prior to sending)
- monitor sentiment around certain topic (e.g. exception reporting for retutation)

What is sentiment good for? Often just a score a lone is not actionable. Net promoter scores and similar metrics could benefit from sentiment modeling, but senitment seems best when paired with other output (entity recognition, real time text parsing for call/chat data, workflow analysis re: customer satisfaction).
